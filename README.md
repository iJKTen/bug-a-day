# My list of bugs and how I solved them

I always wanted to have my own personal bug tracker. I tried the pen and paper approach but could never find where I wrote it down. I am now planning to use this repo to store my bugs on the issues page [here](https://github.com/iJKTen/bug-a-day/issues).

## How to use this repo

1. Create a new issue and describe the bug
2. Add a new comment explaining **why the bug happened**
3. Add a new comment explaining **How I fixed the bug**
4. Last comment should be **Lessons Learned**
5. Close the issue.
